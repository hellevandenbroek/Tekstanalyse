Coyotes can't help that they're predators. Humans can choose compassion. To avoid conflict with them, use motion-activated lights or sprinklers at night to scare them away, avoid leaving pet food outside, and do not leave animal companions unattended outdoors. 
The fur trim that lines the hoods of jackets comes from wild coyotes who were trapped, killed, and skinned.
