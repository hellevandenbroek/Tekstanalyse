Actor and longtime PETA supporter Edie Falco has had enough of cruel experiments on rats, so she left voice mails for the university’s entire faculty and staff — all 2,000 of them 👏 
SeaWorld abuses these majestic animals, confining them in tanks too small to allow the orcas to swim the 200 miles each day they would in their natural habitat. We hope you’ll reconsider your support. 
We just don't need to test on animals. The alternatives are more humane AND more reliable. Read more: 
We can use in vitro methods and computer simulations. Read more about the humane alternatives here: 
Because animal tests are so unreliable, they make those human trials all the more risky. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has noted that 95 percent of all drugs that are shown to be safe and effective in animal tests fail in human trials because they don’t work. 
The reality is that we just don't need to test on animals. The alternatives are more reliable. Learn more: 
Research for the polio vaccine involved two separate bodies of work—the non-animal studies, which were awarded the Nobel Prize, and the subsequent animal experiments, which the Nobel committee refused to recognize as anything more than wasteful. 
From a moral standpoint, actions that harm others (and the environment) aren't matters of personal choice. 
True! But the biggest difference we can make is go vegan 😊 
Plant foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and nuts 🌱😊https://t.co/Yz6ojJYZ04 
Vegans don't eat any animal products, including fish. 
🙌❤️ 
Thank you for caring ❤️ 
❤️ 
Thank you for choosing compassion! 💙🐟 
Overfishing is another good reason to go vegan. Nearly one-third of all species of fish have declined in population in the last 15 years, and many species may be wiped out in the next decade. 
There is no humane way to exploit and kill animals. Animal agriculture also hurts the environment, so it's best to make the switch to plant-based farming 🌱😊 
This will only get worse and worse unless everyone takes responsibility and goes vegan. A permanent change requires that we fix the underlying problem. 
True--and they need to stop. Take action here: 
👏👏👏 
True! These acts are just degrading 💔 
Isn't it awful? Here's how you can help: 
Rescued by a group of kind individuals! 🐾❤️ These lovely folks near LA tried everything to help a cat stuck in a tree for over a week. No one helped, so they called PETA who found a kind tree climber. Now, the sweet kitty is safe and will no longer live on the scary streets! 
There’s nothing stranger than the sight of an adult human drinking the milk designed for calves! There’s a reason dairy consumption in humans increases risk of ovarian and prostate cancers, acne, and brittle bones: 
We sure are—and will be until the dairy industry is done for good. Cows produce milk for the same reason humans do: to nourish their young. We have no right to kill calves so we can steal the milk that’s meant for them. #DitchDairy 
Yesssss! We’re not just smiling—we’re beaming. The future is vegan 🌱💚 
Right?! Thanks for being so enlightened and ahead of the game 😘 
Not at all! Most of us at PETA take care of rescued dogs and cats 😊 What we oppose is breeding. There just isn’t a responsible way to bring more animals into a world with no room for the ones it already has. 
Don’t worry—we won’t come for you! But why not let your companion be an indoor cat? That’s the best way to keep cats AND lizards safe 😊 
Sending love your way! Hoping on a speedy recovery for Puka ❤️

Of course we need to eat, but that doesn't mean we need to eat animals. Going vegan is the very best thing we can do for our health. 
Most of the animals who kill for food could not survive if they didn’t. That is not the case for us. We are MUCH better off not eating meat 😊https://t.co/Nvz8xC1eYw

Neurobiologists have long recognized that fish have nervous systems that comprehend and respond to pain. 
Without any legal protection from cruel treatment, these intelligent, complex animals are impaled, crushed, suffocated, or cut open and gutted, all while they’re fully conscious. 
Awful! They deserve so much better.

Surely you don't think fish end up on your plate having never lived! Fish are impaled, crushed, suffocated, or cut open and gutted beforehand, all while they’re fully conscious. 
All fish suffer before they make it to your plate. Suffocation is never kind. Please go vegan! 
No form of abuse is acceptable. The species of the victim makes no difference. We all feel pain and we all deserve compassion.

The sixty-five percent of adults worldwide believed to be lactose-intolerant would beg to differ. Cow’s milk is suited to the nutritional needs of calves, who have four stomachs and gain hundreds of pounds in a matter of months. 
It truly is. Humans are the ONLY species who regularly drinks the milk of another species &amp; beyond the natural age of weaning. #DitchDairy

Researchers have created a detailed map of more than 20 pain receptors, or “nociceptors,” in fish’s mouths and heads—including those very areas where an angler’s barbed hook would penetrate a fish’s flesh. 
You'll be glad to know that we encourage everyone to leave animals off their plates and go vegan every single day! 🙂

Some animals kill other animals for food out of necessity. We as humans don’t need to eat animals to survive—and the evidence shows that humans are not naturally built to eat meat: 
The "dog" is a prop. PETA is urging anyone who’s repulsed by the prospect of chowing down on dog meat to extend that compassion to all other animals and go vegan. 
This is a campaign by the deceitfully-named Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), a front group for the meat industry &amp; other corporations that hurt &amp; exploit billions of animals per year. They have created a smear campaign against PETA. 
PETA’s president has been advocating for animals for DECADES — and she’s more fired up than ever 🔥 
This is AWFUL 😡 A snake was reportedly decapitated on a film set just for resting under a rock in a state park! PETA is calling for a police investigation into the potential violation of #Alabama’s Cruelty to Animals Law. 
You know what’s NOT sweet about today's #SweetSixteen game? One of the team’s schools is buying dogs from shelters and using them for fatal anatomy labs. Shame on you, 😡 DEMAND they end this cruel practice 👉 #MarchMadness 
That isn't true. For example, in a study where rainbow trout had painful acetic acid or bee venom injected into their sensitive lips, they stopped eating, rocked back and forth on the tank floor, and rubbed their lips against the tank walls. 
They deserve SO much better! 
It's awful. Thank you for caring ❤️ 
It doesn't work that way. Going vegan is the very best thing you can do for the environment, since animal agriculture is a leading contributor to deforestation and because most plastic in the ocean is from abandoned fishing nets. 
"It's funny, but I truly never liked the circus… You've got animals being tortured... It's like a horror show. What's to like?"— #Dumbo director Tim Burton

Truth 🙌🙌🙌 It’s SO weird that humans are drinking the milk of another species that is meant for baby cows. #DitchDairy 
Apart from humans, no species regularly drinks milk beyond the natural age of weaning OR drinks the milk of another species.

PETA opposes all slaughter of animals, whether for Eid or for Thanksgiving. 
Animals of all species, including humans, feel pain. That's what matters. We also don't need to eat meat to survive. We're much better off eating plant sources of protein, like nuts, beans, lentils, tofu, quinoa, and edamame. 
It isn't "natural." Meat consumption in humans is linked to heart disease, cancer, AND diabetes 😷 
Please do! You'll save SO many animals each year 💚 This guide can get you started:

Meat substitutes can help new vegans make the transition easier 😊As long as no animals are harmed, we're all for it. 
There's no reason to be so concerned about what these vegan alternatives are called. The simple fact is that the vegan option does not harm animals. 
Maybe you'll just have to try it and get back to us 😉 
One of the most tear-jerking moments in #Dumbo is when he is separated from his mother. In real life, separating mothers and their young is common in nearly ALL industries that exploit animals, including circuses, movies, and TV shows 💔 😔 
Ripped from their homes, torn away from their families, left to suffocate and die — thousands of fish suffer every day so humans can eat them 😠 #FishFeelPainDay 
Large fish, like salmon, are sometimes bashed on the head with a wooden bat at slaughter plants. Many are seriously injured but still alive when they are cut open 😩 #FishFeelPainDay 
It's not healthy for us to drink the milk meant for babies of another species. Despite the hype, cow’s milk actually robs our bones of calcium.

The very best thing we can do for animals is go vegan! We hope you will too if you haven't already 💚 
All animals deserve our love and respect! 
Mother cows make milk for their newborn baby to drink. The only reason cows produce more milk than they naturally would is because they are injected with and fed hormones. This is not natural or normal. Humans have no need for the breast milk of another species. 
Thanks for the love! 💕 
You should try vegan cheese! :) 
All dairy is breast milk from cows. Whether we drink it out of a glass or directly from the cow makes no difference. Go vegan 😊 
There's no excuse for cruelty. Animals are not commodities to be bought and sold. To learn more about this industry and the spiked rings you see in the video: 
Did you know? When fish are yanked out of water they begin to suffocate. Joaquin Phoenix shows how pulling a fish out of water is like drowning a human 😣 #FishFeelPainDay 
This uncomfortable truth needs to be discussed and changed! If she’s not your Mom, it’s not your milk. 
Adult humans are drinking the milk of another species that was meant for their babies every day. It doesn’t sound like a correct way of life to us either! #DitchDairy 
So are we. Humans are the only species who regularly steal milk from another species even though it’s not suited for our bodies. Stop being a part of this and #DitchDairy! 
Cow's breast milk isn't meant for humans; it's for calves. There's a reason humans who consume dairy suffer from higher rates of prostate cancer, bone fractures, acne, and ovarian cancer: 
It’s the truth! Humans are the ONLY species who regularly drinks the milk of another species &amp; beyond the natural age of weaning. Which is super weird! 
Isn’t it though? Cow’s milk is suited to the nutritional needs of calves, who have four stomachs and gain hundreds of pounds in a matter of months. You’re not a baby cow, stop drinking cow’s milk.
