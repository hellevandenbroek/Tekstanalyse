As with other industries where animals are raised for a profit, the interests of the animals used in the wool industry are rarely considered. Please read: 
Horses deserve better! Here's how you can help: 
These people freaked out when they were told they were drinking “dog milk” 🤷‍♂️ 
Dogs are FAMILY and they deserve to be treated that way 🐶 Happy Birthday to compassionate hip hop genius, who knows dogs don't belong on chains ❤️ 
The most #Instagram-able museum of the millennium? PETA's opening the first "Museum of Tofu," and experiences will include a tofu touch tank, sponge painting with tofu, a tofu catapult, tofu wrestling pools, and more! 
Great shirt, but hardly a spoof given how abysmally ignorant some people are of diet’s relationship to health, let alone… 
Blackfish really shows how cruel is 😥 No animal should be forced to live in captivity. They need to #EmptyTheTanks! 🐳 ❤️ 
That’s so amazing! You got this 😊 If you ever need some inspo: 
And imagine how much lower those emissions would be if everyone went vegan! 😊 
We can’t stop thinking about all the adult humans who insist on drinking the milk designed for babies of another species 😬 #DitchDairy 
Sometimes it takes a little controversy to start a conversation, doesn’t it? 😉 
We’re proud of our provocative campaign history 😊 We don’t mind shaking things up a little and giving the public a reason to start talk about issues that matter. 
And that’s why you’re the best ❤️ Thank you for being a friend to animals! 
Congratulations on winning an NAACP Image Award for your role on Empire! 👏 ❤️ 
Going vegan is a great idea! You’ll be helping animals, the planet, AND your health 😊 
Ooh, it looks good! That’s a great way to start your Monday 😊 
It’s never too early to talk about why you’re vegan 😉 
Joan sounds like a fantastic friend 🙌 Vegan fudge is the best 😍 
Looks delish! You should check out Choices Café next 😊 
No animal should EVER suffer this way 👎 Thank you for speaking out ❤️ 
It’s so unacceptable! 💔 PETA is calling on California Governor Gavin Newsom to form a panel to investigate. 
We ❤️ her compassion for animals! 
Did you know that badgers are related to wolverines? And some are resistant to snake venom? Badgers are badass, and their hair belongs on them — not on paint, makeup, or shaving brushes. 
Stylish, sporty sneakers are HOT right now 👟 🔥 And thanks to brands like and others that are making plenty of #vegan options, choosing animal-free kicks is easier than ever 🙌

Numerous studies have shown that meat is not ideal for the human body and may actually be making us sick and killing us. 
We can harm fewer plants by going vegan, because eating plants directly, rather than feeding them to animals and then killing those animals for their flesh, requires far fewer plants and hurts fewer animals. 
Thank you for refusing to visit circuses with animal acts ❤️

PETA IS vocal about animal sacrifice never being needed. We have posted about the issue on many of our websites: We have also held demonstrations against it. 
Primates in labs are trapped in tiny cages, sometimes for DECADES. One experimenter video recorded psychologically traumatized monkeys in labs who were self-mutilating. PETA is suing the school for illegally withholding the footage. 
Can you guess what the #1 item on was in 2018? BEAN BURRITOS 😍 Looks like America loves #vegan food 🙌 
Another horse has died at Santa Anita Race Track, marking the 23rd death since December 26th. PETA is calling on California Governor to form an independent panel to investigate the training and veterinary practices in California racing. 
It’s unjust to imprison animals in cages &amp; torment them in experiments. Animals aren’t tools. They’re feeling individuals who deserve to live a life free from abuse, just like you. Urge Congress to tell NIH to STOP funding experiments on animals 👉

All of PETA’s “naked” advertisements are intended to underscore an important message, whether it’s to reveal the cruelty of fur production, to emphasize the health benefits of vegan foods, or to show the vulnerability of animals in laboratories. 
YES! Not your mom, not your milk. 
For the truth about PETA's shelter, please see: 
White going vegetarian is a great step for animals, they still suffer immensely in order for humans to eat eggs and cheese. Going vegan is the best way to help the most animals 😊 
All animals have feelings and have a right to live free from unnecessary suffering—regardless of whether they are considered “pests” or “ugly.” 
That's right! Humans have no business drinking cow's milk that is meant for calves. 
Cows only produce milk after being forcibly impregnated. Then their babies are taken away so humans can steal their milk. 
You can enjoy animal-friendly destinations instead 😄

At PETA, we love pits. We want to protect those already in good homes and we want the rest sterilized so that no more are born into an abusive world that fetishizes them to their detriment.

Animals are not entertainment! #BoycottAnimalCircuses 
A lot of vegans grew up eating meat and stopped eating animals to avoid taking part in their suffering. Vegan alternatives help with the transition. As long as it doesn't harm animals, vegans will eat it! 
No animal deserves to be eaten alive 💔 
The smart, compassionate men and women who pose “naked” for PETA choose to do so because they support the cause and want to take action to help animals. 
Yes! 
Thank you SO much for saving lives ❤️
