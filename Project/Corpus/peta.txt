Now even “sharks” are embracing vegan, #CrueltyFree products! 🦈 ❤️ Wild Earth, a startup developing #vegan, humanely tested dog food, just landed a $550,000 investment from Mark Cuban on #SharkTank 👏 
You can spot a cooler dolphin show in the wild! Dolphins love playing in open oceans, where they can swim up to 60 miles each day. Captivity just doesn’t compare to home. 
We hope you’ll reconsider your feelings about this! Languishing in tiny tanks, separated from their families and unable to communicate with other orcas, is no “party” for these inquisitive animals 💔

Bigotry in all its ugly forms is wrong — regardless who the victim is. Speciesism is the misguided belief that one species is more important than another — but other animals are individuals with the right to live freely, just like humans.

All breeders fuel the animal overpopulation crisis, and every time someone purchases a puppy or a kitten instead of adopting from an animal shelter, homeless animals lose their chance of finding a home—and will be euthanized. 
With the help of our 6.5 million members and supporters worldwide, PETA accomplishes great victories for animals. 
Eyewitness investigators document evidence of crimes so law enforcement officials can end the abuse. Without them, we wouldn't be able show people the truth about what goes on in these industries.
