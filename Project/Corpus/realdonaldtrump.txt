‚ÄúThe Trump Administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to Iran for its sinister behavior, at no cost to the U.S. or our allies. That‚Äôs the definition of a foreign-policy achievement.‚Äù Bret Stephens, We are getting stronger all over the world, watch! 
Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out &amp; we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico! 
It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws. In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved. But the Dems don‚Äôt care about the crime, they don‚Äôt want any victory for Trump and the Republicans, even if good for USA!

So funny that The New York Times &amp; The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee! 
...The problem is, no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get, no matter what we give them, it will never be enough. Just watch, they will Harass &amp; Complain &amp; Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO, we‚Äôve got a Country to run! 
Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats, until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!). After more than two years since the ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù statement was made by a dirty cop, I got the answers I wanted, the Truth..... 
Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, &amp; Stock Market, would have both been much higher &amp; World Markets would be in a better place! 
....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and ‚Äútalk.‚Äù Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! 
....through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn‚Äôt immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING..... 
The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, &amp; they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, &amp; Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S....
