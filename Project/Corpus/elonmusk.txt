Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it 
Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but we‚Äôre going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads. 
Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon. 
Thank you!

Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint. 
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment. 
No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps

We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don‚Äôt need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle. 
You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber. 
Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations. 
Agreed 
Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed. 
Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout ‚Ä¶

This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules. 
Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production

Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity. 
Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions. 
Still get this question a lot, even though Norway üá≥üá¥ has highest Tesla cars per person on üåè (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

In retrospect, lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday. 
However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak 
We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board. 
When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes. 
Yes 
Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too

Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although they‚Äôre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term.

Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time 
We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide. 
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput. 
Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. 
So true ü§£ 
Extremely important merch 
Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm) 
Yes, but an engine shouldn‚Äôt count until it flies 
Ukraine did play a major role 
Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won‚Äôt notice it in range. 
If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power
