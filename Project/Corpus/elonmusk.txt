We‚Äôre going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey. 
Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can‚Äôt. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that‚Äôs very rare. 
Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year‚Äôs vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying. 
Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what‚Äôs there. Not impossible. 
Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2. 
Anyone who bought FSD will get it 
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward ‚ÄúHW3‚Äù will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. 
Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.

I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo.

Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it 
Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but we‚Äôre going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads. 
Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon. 
Thank you!

Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint. 
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.

We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don‚Äôt need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle. 
You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber. 
Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations. 
Agreed 
Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.

This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.

Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity. 
Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions.

In retrospect, lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday. 
However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak 
We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board. 
When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
