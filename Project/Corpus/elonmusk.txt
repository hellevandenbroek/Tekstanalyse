@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.

@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.

@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors.

@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions.

@johnny0129 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.

@comeaujo @ValueAnalyst1 @Tesla Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time
@flcnhvy We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide.
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.
Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. https://t.co/h2MMBjkzLu
