First revamped Jordan B Peterson podcast, partnered with Westwood One, featuring my co-host and daughter Mikhaila Peterson: It's a 12 Rules for Life lecture from Seattle.

Comments? Thoughts? Did a presidency destroying investigation just end with a whimper? Am I missing something? 
Is it just me does even CNN regard this as anticlimactic? 
The end of ISIS? Seems like news. 
A sign of the times.... These large platforms are going to destroy themselves with censorship. Where do they think it will stop? 
With the clear exception of Vox Day.

Good news from Africa, we hope: 
The logical inconsistencies and incoherencies in the radical leftist collectivist policies continue to unfold in reality, just as they must: 
Thank you Niall, for your support I'm going ahead with a series of Exodus lectures, regardless, but I think they will be lesser because I will not have had the opportunity to consult with a diverse group of experts. 
The Globe and Mail on the Cambridge rescindment of my fellowship there: 
Because our Prime Minister clearly has the ethical integrity to make these sorts of decisions properly: Just look at SNC Lavalin: 
From Stephen Blackwood, with whom I had done some work in Cambridge... 
Apologies: Freudian slip: Vox Day. And that's a hell of a pen name. As they say, pride goeth before a fall ("Vox Dei: means voice of God: 
I believe Vox Dei considers himself alt-right. Am I wrong about this? If so, apologies... 
Google goes full social justice. You can't imbibe just a little of the doctrine, without being infected by the entire Here's document one, for the "diversity training" as of Feb 2018, Allyship 101:

"The reasons for this lack of interest and employment figures range from peer pressure to a lack of role models." No, The primary reason for this, as the data show, is that women are more interested in people than things. The causes do not appear social. 
How about not censoring your creators and their supporters? Now that would be "empowering" (a detestable word, in my estimation).

The problem is that almost everyone genuinely has a serious problem. So once the "disability accommodation" floodgates open, compromising objective testing, there's no stopping it. And it's really not good for the students.

Trouble in virtue paradise: 
Inevitable. 
Pure narcissism. It's become either shockingly common or widely over reported. I suspect and hope it's the latter.

Tell the man. 
You'd hope this would be obvious and it's quite the mystery why that's no longer true 
It's very hard to see this as anything but comical to the point of surreal: 
Apparently it's necessary to note that this was sarcasm. Twitter's just not so good with sarcasm. Or maybe I'm just not good enough at it. 
It was a joke. I forget those don't work very well on Twitter. Eric knew it, though.

Low conscientiousness, psychologically speaking.

Think: the SAT can't be bought. At least not easily. This precisely contradicts your argument, as the SAT protects against corruption of acceptance by wealth alone. 
Your "work." 
The SAT is like democracy. Worst system, except for every other system. Could be improved with a conscientiousness measure. Everything else is far too easily gamed by money, status and connections. And prep courses don't help much, despite the sales pitch. 
Good luck. The Australians were really welcoming to me. 
Dead on. The socialists in the UK in the early twentieth century used such tests to equalize the socioeconomic playing field. Effectively. 
Because the demonizers are organized, self righteous, shameless and most inexcusably both ignorant of biology and pridefully ignorant of that fact.

There's no science in the service of identity politics.

Heterodoxy is only necessary for those who hold the wrong opinions. Like you,

The Antichrist by Friedrich Nietzsche a book from my great books list 
The iron law of unexpected consequences. 
"Science" knows perfectly well. 
Another narcissist takes the easy way out, demolishing the legitimate striving of teammates and opponents alike, and justifies it with gender doctrine. Manipulative barely begins to describe it. 
Dragging, kicking and screaming.... 
More trouble for our oh so virtuous Prime Minister

These two articles together August Feb 22 2019 (https://t.co/JFiYvoym8q) and Aug 17 2018 (https://t.co/3JHRxxf1fn) indicating levels of corruption that are almost beyond comprehension. Maybe believing Catholics should go on strike, stop attending church.
