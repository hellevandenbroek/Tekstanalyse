Another Venezuelan triumph. Oil rich and energy poor. Maybe Canada can manage something similar with Trudeau's influence on the oil patch. 
1. Biological sex differences in psychology and behaviour are real. 2. Some differences between the sexes are producedâ€¦ 
We often hear that renewables are growing exponentially? Let's test this. Here are the trends in growth rate of wind powerâ€¦ 
The faster we dispense with the economic catastrophe of the Liberals and their pathetic virtuousness the better.

Congratulations, Ambassador Craft. JBP. 
What explanation can there be for this? Excessive competition for attention as media sources multiply? 
Good news both for the environment and for those of us who appreciate electricity 
Read this thread. Keep it up 
Try imagining a society run by such persons. 
So now we've come to this. This article can trumpeted as a paean to left values. How absolutely despicable. 
Ideology now triumphs over science by law in Canada with regard to sex differences. Gender is deemed to have no relationship to sex, and to claim otherwise may be criminal.

And if Whatcott refuses to, or cannot pay? Then a move from tribunal to standard court proceedings &amp; potentially more severe penalties, as noted when I objected to Bill C16. I don't care what you think of Whatcott: this sets a very bad precedent.

"The reasons for this lack of interest and employment figures range from peer pressure to a lack of role models." No, The primary reason for this, as the data show, is that women are more interested in people than things. The causes do not appear social.

The problem is that almost everyone genuinely has a serious problem. So once the "disability accommodation" floodgates open, compromising objective testing, there's no stopping it. And it's really not good for the students.

Trouble in virtue paradise: 
Inevitable. 
Pure narcissism. It's become either shockingly common or widely over reported. I suspect and hope it's the latter. 
Sorry about your dog, Dave.

Instant results. 
The pathology of identity politics on the extreme right.... 
With surprise ending! 
Tell the man. 
You'd hope this would be obvious and it's quite the mystery why that's no longer true 
It's very hard to see this as anything but comical to the point of surreal: 
Apparently it's necessary to note that this was sarcasm. Twitter's just not so good with sarcasm. Or maybe I'm just not good enough at it. 
It was a joke. I forget those don't work very well on Twitter. Eric knew it, though. 
The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker a book from my great books list 
You haven't seen anything yet 
Low conscientiousness, psychologically speaking. 
Because we both oppose the most radical of leftists and have been reasonably effective in doing so. 
More ethical behavior from our virtue signaling PM... 
The rationale for the alternate platform we are making rapid progress on multiplies apace. Announcement soon. 
A call to ban well known Jewish neo-nazi gateway drug Ben Shapiro on charges of corrupting the youth. You can't make this up 
Taking out Tucker is not going to be easy but it's reassuring to watch them fail 
academic sources suggest the same... 20 to 30 points mostly because of test familiarity

12 Rules for Life Lecture New York April 17: 
Think: the SAT can't be bought. At least not easily. This precisely contradicts your argument, as the SAT protects against corruption of acceptance by wealth alone. 
Your "work." 
The SAT is like democracy. Worst system, except for every other system. Could be improved with a conscientiousness measure. Everything else is far too easily gamed by money, status and connections. And prep courses don't help much, despite the sales pitch. 
Good luck. The Australians were really welcoming to me. 
Dead on. The socialists in the UK in the early twentieth century used such tests to equalize the socioeconomic playing field. Effectively. 
Because the demonizers are organized, self righteous, shameless and most inexcusably both ignorant of biology and pridefully ignorant of that fact.
