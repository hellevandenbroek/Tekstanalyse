@Idubbbz i didnt fuck my squirrel. i didnt cum on my squirrel. i didnt put my dick anywhere near my squirrel. Ive never done anything weird with my squirrel.

When it comes to mass shooters:

-Don't share their name
-Don't share their face
-Don't share their writings
-Don't share their videos
-Don't make them infamous

They are nothing - let's keep it that way.

I'm so sorry for everyone in Christchurch, what a tragedy.
@teddyfresh 😭 Dogs are treasures on this planet 😭
@BatmanGoose @pewdiepie Thats very sweet of her to say
@Idubbbz when you were at my house last, it was so rank I thought I was in a gas chamber, keep your farts in your own god damn neighborhoods you bigot
@chrisdelia Was that cream or nut he used because this is so freaking hot I nutttelled in my pants 👅😛
@mikeboydvideo It's a Teddy bear it happens to me too no idea why 😔
@EthansGazebo @theh3podcast @TheoVon Nice options on that thing
@KrashJordan @HilaKleinH3 @theh3podcast 🙏🙏
@LeonLush We pay 50% in CA because of 10% state income tax so if its really important to you, you have a good opportunity here 🙃

@louistheroux @danreed1000 Louis you are a hero of mine - thank you for continuing to voice reason.
RT @louistheroux: If you can’t see that Michael Jackson was a paedophile after watching @danreed1000 ‘s film you are being wilfully blind.…
@timheidecker Global warming is a Chinese hoax as well*
@HilaKleinH3 My three favorites
@timheidecker A joy &amp; a pleasure!!!!
@GibiOfficial @teddyfresh 🤘🐻🤘
This incredible artist @danobananotoys made a Vape Nation action figure and it's one of the nicest gifts I've ever received 😭 https://t.co/KB6oWRFBYo
@tomsegura Michael Jackson is innocent he didn't have a childhood that's why he sleeps with the same child in bed for 30 nights straight without parents - did I mention he didn't have a childhood?
@tomsegura https://t.co/h6nm3hdmrX
@pewdiepie Needs more jump cuts tbh
@notch I will keep trying and you will come one day 😊 but was that a pass or a somewhat interested but a little nervous possibly yes?
@hankgreen Amazing
@timheidecker @PwhipBgang Dude admits to sleeping frequently in bed with children without parents present - it's a more wild assumption to assume he never tried anything with them.
@timheidecker I'm with you Tim read this thread here

https://t.co/I1WeAPuZr1
@Banks You are on one hand saying you believe he is a prolific child predator and on the other hand saying people shouldn't talk about it? That really doesn't make any sense. What about the victims being accused of lying? Don't they have the right to defend themselves?
@Banks Why does it matter if he's alive or not? He would deny it as he always has. He was possibly the most prolific child predators of all time and a master groomer and manipulator. It's about the victims story and it's an important one. They deserve public support to encourage others.
@zealotonpc First hand accounts of multiple people and lots of evidence to corroborate their whole story including videos, recorded phone calls, faxes, photos. Watch all three parts and let me know what ya think
@OfficialGabeW Bye &amp; enjoy supporting a child molester, hope it never happens to your children or your family
@jessetbowers "know your facts fam?" Nice copy pasta - have you by chance seen the documentary?
@Ize @Jordan_Crocker1 You obviously have not watched the documentary
@DaveStansberry @Jordan_Crocker1 Thank you
@Jordan_Crocker1 They are not being compensated in any way - what money? One sued him and it was dismissed because too much time had passed (nothing to do with the merits) the other has never brought a suit or expected any monetary compensation.
So much respect and love to the brave victims and to Oprah for taking this on. The amount of hate and slander they are receiving is horrifying. Love &amp; appreciation to them all.
Michael Jackson is a child molester.

I don't see enough people talking about #LeavingNeverland &amp; those that do are desperate to discredit the victims but if you watch all 3 parts it's undeniable. It's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen on the topic. Love to the victims
@zumiez @teddyfresh 🤘🐻🤘
@notch come on h3 podcast plz
@OMFGITSOSCAR I tried to save him 😭
@miel Solid case easy win litigation wise, they have already admit to fault in dms and to counter-dmca you have to exhibit good faith that you believe you are right - these dms plainly show that they knew they were wrong and still filed. Easy win.

@DanaTerrace thank you dana very cool
@_AlexHirsch I identify as a fat man
@tallfuzzball Also I totally understand why you cancelled it and I have no hard feelings whatsoever. I wanted it to be a positive experience and I can see that wasn't going to be possible so I'm glad you cancelled it for your own well being. Cheers
@VicBergerIV I just pledged :) god bless
@2gay2lift @tallfuzzball Sorry we didn't get to the do the Podcast Adum :( With the amount of drama generated around this simple booking we figured it was best to avoid the whole thing.
@tallfuzzball Sorry you got harassed for this - seems counter productive to avoid having a conversation at all rather than sitting down with someone you perceive as trans-phobic and learning about each other. Also the claim I'm transphobic is absurd. Best regards
I know this is low hanging fruit but really just imagine thinking the edge of the world is a giant ice wall and not a sphere. Just get a boat and go there Columbus
Imagine thinking the world is flat
@smosh Wow, that's incredible. Congratulations guys and a god bless to the great @rhettmc &amp; @linklamont 🙏🙏🙏🙏
